## Automated Testing

- Automated tests were written using Django's `APITestCase`.
- The following areas were covered:
  - User authentication.
  - CRUD operations on cryptocurrency data.
  - Profile and user preference management.
- Used coverage reports to ensure a high percentage of codebase testing.

### Key Areas of Testing

#### User Authentication Testing

- **LogoutRouteTest**: Validates that the logout route clears cookies, ensuring secure user logout.
- **CurrentUserSerializerTest**: Tests the serialization of current user data, verifying the presence of expected fields like username, email, and profile image.

#### CRUD Operations on Currency Post Data

- **CurrencyPostListViewTest**: Checks the retrieval of currency posts, ensuring the correct number and details are fetched.
- **CurrencyModelTest**: Validates the creation of currency models with attributes like current price and market cap.
- **FetchDataFromCoinMarketCapTest**: Tests the functionality of fetching data from CoinMarketCap, handling both successful and failed data retrieval.

#### Profile and User Preference Management

- **UserProfileAPITest**: Tests user profile retrieval and updates, ensuring correct data handling and response.
- **FavouriteCurrenciesModelTest**: Validates the creation of favorite currencies and the serializer's functionality, including unique constraint checks.

#### Permission and Access Control Testing

- **IsOwnerOrReadOnlyTest**: Tests custom permission class `IsOwnerOrReadOnly` to ensure that only owners can perform unsafe methods (POST, DELETE), while safe methods (GET) are accessible by any user.

### Test Implementation Examples

- **CurrencyPostModelTest**: Sets up a user, currency, and currency post, and validates the creation and attributes of the currency post.
- **CurrencyPostListViewTest**: Creates a currency post and uses an API request to validate the retrieval of currency posts.

## Bugs

#### During Development

- Encountered issues with data serialization in the cryptocurrency models, which were resolved by adjusting the serializer methods.
- Initially faced CORS issues, which were fixed by correctly setting up Django CORS headers.

#### Post-Deployment

- No critical bugs were found post-deployment. Minor issues were promptly resolved.

## Unfixed Bugs

- As of the latest update, there are no known unfixed bugs.
