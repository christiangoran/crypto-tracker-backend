## Project Structure

The structure of this project is built to support a scalable and maintainable backend for cryptocurrency tracking. The project is organized into different Django apps, each serving a particular function within the larger application.

### Code Structure

The project's codebase is divided into various application folders to separate concerns and enhance modularity:

#### Project Apps

- **currency**: Manages cryptocurrency-related data and operations.
- **currencypost**: Handles user-generated content about cryptocurrencies.
- **favouritecurrencies**: Enables users to select and manage their favorite cryptocurrencies.
- **userprofile**: Manages user profile information and settings.

#### Core Django apps

- **settings.py**: Central configuration for the Django project, including middleware, installed apps, and database settings.
- **urls.py**: Route declarations for the project, directing HTTP requests to the appropriate view based on the URL.
- **wsgi.py**: Entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve the project.
- **models.py**: Definitions for the database schema and behavior of the application's data.

## User Stories

The application is built around user-centric stories that guide the development process to ensure the final product meets the actual needs of its users. Each epic contains several user stories, each with its own acceptance criteria.

## Bugs & problems

- Hitting the 32kb limit on Heroku config vars

  - When trying to add a config var with the coinmarketcap API, I am unable to, and the most probable cause for it is that I have reached the 32kb limit that Heroku has on config vars.
    - Solution: There seem to have been a corrupted Heroku app, after deleting and creating a new app, I could add the necessary config vars

- After deploying to Heroku, my currency model was empty and I need to find out how to make my Heroku app call the Coinmarketcap API to populate my currency model.

  - I added the Heroku Scheduler service to my Heroku app and configured it to run "python3 manage.py update_currencies" every 10 minutes.

- When sending a request from my signup form, a new user was registered to the database, but somewhere in the execution order after the registration I get a 500 error response. After looking through Heroku logs and not finding anything but a 500 error. I added LOGGING to my Django settings.py.
  - Solution: After 4-5 hours of searching for what the error could be. What eventually appeared to be the problem was the use of useNavigate/useHistory and that the use of this changed with the latest version of React. So after changing the code snippet "history.push("/signin");" and "const history = useNavigate();" to "const navigate = useNavigate();" and "navigate("/signin")" I managed to finally make it work.

LOGGING = {
'version': 1,
'disable_existing_loggers': False,
'handlers': {
'console': {
'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
},
},
'loggers': {
'django': {
'handlers': ['console'],
'level': 'DEBUG',
'propagate': True,
},
},
}

- The problem was then identified as being a missing Meta.model in my CurrentUserSerializer

- Having problems authenticating when sending requests from my frontend and I am not sure why my currentUser token is 'undefined'
  - All of this has been a cocktail of errors. The backend views.py for favouritecurrencies needed to be changed so only the specific authenticated user could retrieve his/her specific list of favourites. Then this array of favourites needed to be handled correcly in the frontend.

# BlockBoard Backend API

<img src="/media/landingPage.png" ><br>

<hr>
Welcome to the backend of BlockBoard Crypto Tracker, a dynamic and robust web application designed to provide insights and analysis for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This backend serves as the powerhouse of the application, handling data management, user authentication, and seamless integration with Coinmarketcap's cryptocurrency APIs.

Built using Django and Django REST framework, the backend infrastructure offers a secure, scalable, and efficient solution to manage vast amounts of data related to cryptocurrencies. The system is engineered to cater to both novice users and seasoned traders, providing them with up-to-date information and an interactive platform to track their favorite digital currencies.

This was my 5th and last project as part of Code Institutes course in Full Stack Software Development.

## Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive booking and management platform for the Dome Restaurant. The platform allows customers to easily reserve tables, add special notes for their bookings, and specify the number of guests. On the other side, staff members can manage these bookings efficiently through a staff-only interface. The system ensures that only available tables are offered to the customers, considering variables like time, date, and capacity. The platform is designed to handle real-world scenarios with ease. The application was built using Python (Django), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data being stored in a PostgreSQL database and images on a Cloudinary account.

### Structure<hr>

The website is designed with a focus on user experience and is divided into 6 distinct pages, each serving a specific purpose. The content displayed on these pages varies based on whether the user is authenticated and whether they are a client or staff member. Here are the details:

- **Register/Login:** These pages allow users to create an account or authenticate into an existing one, providing access to various exclusive features.
- **Logout:** This is implemented as a modal dialog that allows users to securely log out of their accounts.
- **Home:** Accessible to all users, this page showcases the restaurant's ambiance, popular dishes, opening & closing times and contact info.
- **Menu:** This page displays the restaurant's menu items. An "Add to Favourite" feature is available only to logged-in clients.
- **Reservations/profile:** Exclusive to authenticated users, this page enables both clients and staff members to make or manage bookings.
- **Staff Manage Bookings:** Accessible only to staff members, this page displays all registered bookings, which can be grouped and filtered by date.

#### Flowchart

### Skeleton<hr>

**Wireframes**<br>
The wireframes for mobile and desktop were created with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) tool and can be viewed <details>

<summary>Here:</summary>
<img src="static/images/restaurant_wireframe.png"><br>
</details><br>

**Database**<br>
The project uses ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL relational database for storing the data.<br>
Two diagrams were created to represent the relationships between the tables. The first diagram was created before the website was developed, and it was used to identify the most relevant and useful attributes and tables. The final diagram was created after the website was developed, and it reflects the changes that were made to the attributes and tables.

#### Create bookings

Every user that is authenticated can access the _Reservation_ page for making a reservation. This feature provides a form where the user can fill in the reservation details.

- The form is for selecting the date and time interval of the booking.
  The inputs are validated after the following rules:
  - The Date value should not be less than the current day;<br>
  - Entering Name, date and number of people is required;<br>
  - Maximum number of guests for a reservation is 8 people;<br>
  - The user can choose times from a list;
    - 1: 12:00 - 12:45
    - 2: 14:00 - 15:45
    - 3: 16:00 - 17:45
    - 4: 18:00 - 19:45
    - 5: 20:00 - 21:45<br><br>

<img src="static/images/create_reservation.png" width="30%"><br><br>

- If the reservation is submitted successfully, a success message will appear

#### Menu

The "Menu" section of our Django-based restaurant app allows users to easily browse through categorized dishes.

<img src="static/images/menu.png" width="30%"><br><br>

#### Information

The "Information" page serves as a one-stop destination for all essential details about the Dome Restaurant. It features our opening hours, contact information, and physical location.

<img src="static/images/information.png" width="30%"><br><br>

### Potential Future Features

- Add a feature where staff can add, remove and manage menu entries in the front-end interface.

- Email confirmation for users when a reservation is made, to decrease the risk of the reservation becoming a so called no-show.

- Password reset function where the user will get an email with a reset-password-link in case current password is forgotten.

    - iPhone 11
    - iPhone 13
    - iPhone 6/7/8
